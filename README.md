# pain

Finding the perfect terminal emulator is a pain.

A cross-platform, multi-pane terminal emulator with nested splits, resizing,
grouping with broadcast input, and session persistence — built on Alacritty's
VT/PTY backend with an original GPU-rendered frontend.

## Why

Terminator is great but is Linux/GTK-only. iTerm2 is great but is Mac only.
Alacritty is fast and cross-platform but excludes tabs and splits. This project
is inspired by the greats and attempts to combine them into a single native
application for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed history, and
[releases](../../releases) for binaries.

## Install

### Debian / Ubuntu

Add the APT repository, for `apt upgrade` support:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://w-p.github.io/pain/pain-archive-keyring.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/pain.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/pain.gpg] https://w-p.github.io/pain ./" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pain.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install pain
```

### macOS

macOS builds ship as a universal `pain.app` (Intel and Apple Silicon in one
download) — drag it to Applications and open it like any other app.

The app isn't code-signed, so Gatekeeper blocks the first launch. Clear the
quarantine flag once — note `-r`, since the flag is set on files inside the
bundle too:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/pain.app
```

`pain.app` is a bundle, which on disk is a *directory*, not a single
executable file. Running `./pain.app` from a shell fails with "permission
denied" (zsh) or "Is a directory" (bash) — that's the shell refusing to
execute a directory, not a problem with the download. To launch it from a
terminal:

```sh
open pain.app                    # hand it to macOS, same as double-clicking
./pain.app/Contents/MacOS/pain   # run the binary directly, to see log output
```

### Fedora / RHEL / Rocky / Alma

Add the DNF repository, for `dnf upgrade` support:

```sh
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://w-p.github.io/pain/rpm/pain.repo
sudo dnf install pain
```

### Any other Linux

Download the AppImage — one file, no install, works on any distribution
with glibc 2.35 or newer (including immutable ones like Silverblue,
Kinoite, and Bazzite):

```sh
curl -fLO https://w-p.github.io/pain/appimage/pain-x86_64.AppImage
chmod +x pain-x86_64.AppImage
./pain-x86_64.AppImage
```

If it exits complaining about FUSE, your distribution doesn't ship
libfuse2 — Fedora and Ubuntu 24.04 among them. Either install it, or run
without it:

```sh
./pain-x86_64.AppImage --appimage-extract-and-run
```

### Windows

Download the archive from [releases](../../releases).

## Usage

Run `pain`. There are no positional arguments — every pane starts your
configured shell.

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `-h`, `--help` | Usage summary, including this machine's config file path |
| `-V`, `--version` | Print the version |
| `-v`, `--verbose[=LIST]` | Diagnostic logging on stderr |

`LIST` is a comma-separated set of `general`, `mouse`, `pty`, `foreground`, or
`all`. The bare flag enables `general` alone — the others fire constantly
enough to drown it out, so each is an explicit opt-in.

On Windows, `pain` is a windowed application, so starting it doesn't open a
console and a shell you launch it from returns immediately. The options above
still print to the terminal you ran them from, and redirecting to a file works
normally — but because the shell no longer waits, their output appears just
after your next prompt. That's how every windowed Windows program with a
command line behaves.

Full documentation is in the man page: `man pain`.

### Keyboard shortcuts

Every shortcut is a default and can be changed — see
[Configuration](#configuration). Keys not listed pass through to the shell.

Shortcuts are written the same way you write them in the config file:
segments separated by spaces.

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `ctrl shift o` | Split pane horizontally |
| `ctrl shift e` | Split pane vertically |
| `ctrl shift w` | Close pane (closing the last one exits) |
| `ctrl shift x` | Zoom pane to fill the window, or restore it |
| `ctrl shift q` | Quit, saving the session |
| `alt up`, `alt down`, `alt left`, `alt right` | Move focus to the neighbouring pane |
| `ctrl shift up`, `ctrl shift down`, `ctrl shift left`, `ctrl shift right` | Resize the focused pane |
| `ctrl +` / `ctrl -` | Font size up / down one point |
| `ctrl 0` | Font size back to the default |

A font size set this way is saved, so it survives a restart.

"Ctrl and plus" is one chord to you and several to the OS, so all of them are
bound: `ctrl =` and `ctrl shift +` are the same physical key on a US layout,
and a numeric keypad sends `ctrl +` with no Shift. Likewise `ctrl -` and
`ctrl shift -`.

Clipboard shortcuts differ per platform, because what a terminal can safely
claim differs per platform:

| Platform | Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows, Linux | `ctrl c` | Copy the selection if there is one, otherwise interrupt the running program |
| Windows, Linux | `ctrl v` | Paste |
| macOS | `cmd c` / `cmd v` | Copy / paste |
| macOS | `cmd q` / `cmd w` | Quit / close pane |

`ctrl c` costs you nothing: with no selection it interrupts exactly as it
always has, and copying clears the selection so a second press interrupts
rather than copying again. `Ctrl+V` does displace readline's `quoted-insert`;
set `"ctrl v" = "none"` to get it back. On macOS the Ctrl key is left alone
entirely, since Command is where the clipboard belongs there.

`Ctrl+Shift+C`/`Ctrl+Shift+V`, the usual Linux-terminal clipboard chords,
are not bound. They only ever existed because the unshifted pair wasn't
available, which is no longer the case on either platform. If you have the
muscle memory, bind them back:

```toml
[keybindings]
"ctrl shift c" = "copy"
"ctrl shift v" = "paste"
```

Pasted text is wrapped in bracketed-paste markers when the running program
supports them, so your shell holds it at the prompt for review instead of
running each line as it arrives. When the program *doesn't* support them, a
multi-line paste asks for confirmation and shows exactly what will be sent.

**Broadcast** — sending your keystrokes to several panes at once — has no
default chord and is set from the title-bar menu. The `broadcast_off`,
`broadcast_group`, and `broadcast_all` actions can be bound if you want them.
Assigning a pane to a group is menu-only: it needs a group name, which a
chord can't carry.

### Mouse

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Double-click / triple-click | Select word / line |
| `Ctrl+click` | Open the URL under the pointer (holding `Ctrl` underlines it first) |
| `Shift+click` | Force local selection, bypassing an app's own mouse reporting |
| Right-click a title bar | Pane menu: split, arrange, group, broadcast, swap shell, settings |
| Right-click a terminal | Terminal menu: copy, paste, close |
| Scroll wheel | Scroll back through that pane's history |

`Shift+click` is the standard escape hatch for selecting text inside
full-screen programs like vim or htop, which would otherwise eat the click.

`Ctrl+click` follows a link that a program marked as one (the OSC 8 escape
sequence, which tools like `cargo` and `gcc` emit), and otherwise falls back
to matching URLs in the visible text. Only `http`, `https`, `ftp`, `ssh` and
`mailto` are opened, whichever way the link was found — a terminal prints
paths and arbitrary output constantly, and handing any of it to the operating
system's default handler on a click is a wider door than this opens.

### Pane activity

Panes you aren't looking at show a dot in their title bar when something has
happened, so a build or a log tail off to the side doesn't need watching:

| Dot | Meaning | Cleared by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blue | The shell produced output since you last focused this pane | Focusing the pane |
| Red | A program rang the terminal bell | Typing into the pane |

The two clear differently on purpose. Output is only interesting for a pane
you aren't watching, so looking at it is enough. A bell is a program asking
for attention, and it usually rings the instant a command starts — while its
own pane is still focused, because you just pressed Enter there. So a bell
survives focus and clears when you next type into that pane, which is what
actually shows you noticed.

## Configuration

Settings live in a TOML file, read at startup and re-read when it changes:

| Platform | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Linux | `~/.config/pain/config.toml` (honours `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/pain/config.toml` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\pain\config.toml` |

`pain --help` prints the resolved path for the machine you're on. The file
doesn't exist until you save settings from the settings panel or create it
yourself, and every key is optional — a partial file is valid, and anything
missing uses its default.

A malformed file is never fatal. A parse failure at startup falls back to
defaults with a message on stderr; a bad edit while running keeps the settings
already loaded rather than resetting them; and individual bad `[keybindings]`
lines are skipped one at a time rather than poisoning the whole table.

```toml
[general]
default_shell = ""            # empty = platform default ($SHELL, or your Windows default)
scrollback_lines = 5000       # lines of history per pane (max 1000000)
confirm_multiline_paste = true

[appearance]
theme = "Graphite"            # any built-in theme; see Themes below
font_family = "monospace"     # any installed monospaced family
font_size = 13                # logical size, scaled by the display's DPI factor (6-48)
ligatures = false             # shape != and => as single glyphs (needs a ligature font)
transparency = 100            # percent: 0 transparent .. 100 opaque
background_color = ""         # empty = follow the theme; a hex value overrides it
accent_color = "#7fa2d6"      # cursor, selection, interactive highlights

[cursor]
style = "block"               # block | underline | beam

[keybindings]
"ctrl shift t" = "split_vertical"
"ctrl v" = "none"             # hand a chord back to the shell
```

`confirm_multiline_paste` is the last check on an unreviewed paste running
arbitrary commands the instant it arrives; turning it off removes that.

`font_size` is a *logical* size scaled by your display's DPI factor, so 13
matches other applications on a scaled display rather than rendering smaller
than everything else.

Numeric settings are clamped to their valid range on load — `font_size` to
6–48, `transparency` to 0–100, `scrollback_lines` to at most 1000000 — with
a note on stderr saying what was changed. A value outside the range is used at
the nearest end rather than reset to its default, since "as big as you'll give
me" is a legible intent; a value that isn't a number at all falls back to the
default.

Colors that carry meaning rather than style — the broadcast-target border and
the pane activity dot, for instance — are fixed and unaffected by
`accent_color`. An unparseable color falls back to its default rather than
failing to load.

### Themes

`theme` picks from over 600 built-in color schemes, compiled into the binary —
there is nothing to download or install. The theme supplies the 16 ANSI colors
programs draw with, plus the default foreground and background. Names match
the familiar ones: `Dracula`, `Tokyo Night`, `Gruvbox Dark`, `Catppuccin
Mocha`, `Solarized Light`, and so on. Matching is case-insensitive, and a name
that isn't recognised falls back to the default rather than failing to load.

Pick one from Settings, where the list is filterable, or set it by hand.

`background_color` is an override: leave it empty and the background follows
whichever theme you choose, which is usually what you want since a theme's
background is part of its design. Set it to a hex value to pin the background
regardless of theme.

All but one theme come from the
[iTerm2-Color-Schemes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes)
collection (MIT). `Graphite` is this app's own default. See
[`assets/themes/README.md`](assets/themes/README.md) for the details and how
to regenerate the table.

### Emoji

Emoji render in color, using whichever color emoji font is installed — Noto
Color Emoji on Linux, Apple Color Emoji on macOS, Segoe UI Emoji on Windows.
Without one, they fall back to whatever monochrome glyph the system can find.

Symbols that programs print as ordinary text — `✓`, `✗`, `★`, `➜` — stay
monochrome and one cell wide on purpose. They have emoji forms in Unicode,
but they're used constantly in build and test output, where turning them into
colored pictures would be worse and would break their alignment.

### Ligatures

Off by default. When enabled, each row's text is shaped in runs so a font can
render `!=` as `≠`, `=>` as `⇒`, and so on. This needs a font that actually
provides them — Fira Code, JetBrains Mono, Cascadia Code, Iosevka. With any
other font it has no visible effect.

It's opt-in for two reasons. Glyph positions come from the font's own advances
rather than from the cell grid, so a font whose ligature widths don't match
its cell width will drift out of alignment; and shaping is real per-frame work
that the default per-character path doesn't do. A ligature is never applied
across a color change or across the cursor, so editing `!=` still shows you
which character you're on.

### Keybindings

A chord is space-separated, case-insensitive, with modifiers in any order and
exactly one non-modifier segment: a single character, `up`/`down`/`left`/
`right`, or `space`. Write `ctrl` (or `control`) and `cmd` (or
`logo`/`super`/`win`).

Spaces rather than `+` so that `+` and `-` are writable as themselves —
`"ctrl +"`. The older `+`-separated form (`"ctrl+shift+e"`) is still read, so
existing config files keep working.

The action `none` unbinds a chord with no replacement. Recognized actions:

`split_horizontal`, `split_vertical`, `close_pane`, `quit`, `focus_up`,
`focus_down`, `focus_left`, `focus_right`, `resize_up`, `resize_down`,
`resize_left`, `resize_right`, `toggle_zoom`, `copy`, `copy_or_interrupt`,
`paste`, `broadcast_off`, `broadcast_group`, `broadcast_all`,
`font_size_increase`, `font_size_decrease`, `font_size_reset`.

Overrides are applied on top of a fresh copy of the defaults each time the
file is read, so deleting a line restores that chord's built-in binding rather
than leaving it stuck at the old override.

## Building from source

Standard Cargo workspace:

```sh
cargo build --release
cargo test --workspace
cargo run -p pain
```

### Linux packages

The `.deb`, `.rpm`, AppImage, and tarball are all produced from one compile
inside a container, which pins the glibc floor at 2.35 rather than letting
it drift upward with whatever the CI runner happens to be running. The same
script CI uses runs locally, with either podman or docker:

```sh
./scripts/linux-packages.sh build    # artifacts into ./dist
./scripts/linux-packages.sh verify   # install and start each one
./scripts/linux-packages.sh all      # both
```

`verify` installs each package into a stock image of the distribution it
targets and starts the application under a virtual display with software
rendering. That last part matters: `--version` returns before the event loop
starts, so it never reaches the X11, Wayland, xkbcommon, or Vulkan
libraries — which are loaded at runtime and are exactly the dependencies
most likely to be declared wrong.
