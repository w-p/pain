//! Determines the name of whatever's actually running in the foreground of
//! a pane right now (e.g. "vim", "npm"), for the title bar.
//!
//! This replaced tracking the terminal's OSC 0/1/2 title for the same
//! purpose: most shells' default prompt only sets that to `user@host: cwd`,
//! refreshed at the prompt, never to the actually-running foreground
//! command — it couldn't answer the question it was being used for.
//!
//! Unix has a real, correct primitive here: `tcgetpgrp` on the pty (exposed
//! by `portable_pty`/`pane::Pty` as `foreground_pgid`) reports the process
//! group currently in the foreground — a shell puts each foreground job in
//! its own process group, led by the job itself, so this is almost always
//! that job's own pid directly. Windows/ConPTY has no equivalent concept;
//! the closest available signal is walking the process tree down from the
//! shell's own pid and picking the most recently started live descendant
//! at each level, as a best-effort approximation of "the current job."
//!
//! Both signals are scoped to a single OS's own process list, which breaks
//! down at a WSL boundary: running `wsl.exe`/`bash` from inside a Windows
//! shell hands the foreground over to a different kernel's process tree
//! entirely, invisible to `sysinfo` on the Windows side — there's no pid to
//! walk to. That isn't fixable here; the title bar's "Swap shell" context
//! menu item (`Graphics::restart_pane_shell`) exists to sidestep it by
//! letting a pane switch directly into the nested shell instead.
//!
//! Even for a pane whose own shell *is* `wsl.exe` directly (via "Swap
//! shell"), the tree-walk fallback used to get stuck reporting a Windows
//! interop helper forever, never the real WSL-side command: `wsl.exe`
//! spawns lasting, never-exiting helper children on the Windows side —
//! `conhost.exe`, then (once that was excluded) `wslhost.exe` took its
//! place as the next one found — and since nothing else Windows can see
//! ever supersedes either, "most recently started live child" kept
//! picking whichever one was left. Fixed by excluding both outright
//! (`is_console_host_implementation_detail`) — the fallback now correctly
//! bottoms out at `wsl.exe`'s own name instead, the most honest answer
//! this mechanism can give given the boundary above.
