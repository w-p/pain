// Build for the windows subsystem, not the console one. Without this, every
// launch gets a console: double-clicking the executable opens a black window
// that then sits there for as long as the terminal is running, and a shell
// that starts it blocks until it exits. Neither happens on macOS or Linux,
// which have no equivalent notion — this is a Windows-only default that has
// to be turned off explicitly.
//
// Applied to debug builds too, deliberately, so development exercises the

// `--help`/`--version`/`--verbose` working from a real terminal; see that
