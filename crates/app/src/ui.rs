//! A right-click context menu for grouping/broadcast-mode control, plus the
//! settings panel it opens into.
//!
//! Group assignment and broadcast-mode selection live here, on demand,
//! rather than as keybindings or a permanently visible panel: Terminator
//! itself only exposes group assignment through its GUI, never a
//! keybinding or a persistent widget — its own right-click menu is the
//! precedent this follows. A first attempt used an always-visible floating
//! `egui::Window`; that's the wrong chrome pattern (screen furniture that's
//! in the way even when nobody's touching it), so this replaced it with a
//! menu that only exists between a right-click and the next action.
//!
//! The settings panel (Milestone 5.4) follows the same "on demand, not
//! furniture" rule but is a different kind of chrome: it's a form you
//! explicitly open and close, the same as Terminator's own Preferences
//! dialog (itself reached through that same right-click menu, not a
//! separate menu bar this app doesn't have) — an `egui::Window` is the
//! right container for that, unlike for the always-on broadcast controls.
