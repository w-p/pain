//! Rasterizes glyphs into 8-bit coverage masks via `cosmic-text`.
//!
//! Two paths, deliberately:
//!
//! - **Per character** ([`GlyphRasterizer::rasterize`]) — the default. Grid
//!   cells are fixed-width, so each character is rasterized independently and
//!   cached by `char`. Nothing is shaped across cell boundaries, which is
//!   what makes it cheap.
//! - **Per run** ([`GlyphRasterizer::shape_run`]) — for ligature support,
//!   which is opt-in. A sequence of cells is shaped together so the font can
//!   substitute one glyph for several characters (`!=` becoming `≠`).
//!   Shaping is real work, so results are cached per run text and the whole
//!   cache is dropped whenever the font changes.
//!
//! The two paths coexist rather than one replacing the other: the per-char
//! path is what an idle terminal spends nothing on, and ligatures shouldn't
//! cost that for people who leave them off.
